              Carlton is a tranquil village situated in the heart of Coverdale,
              making it the perfect place to use as a base to explore the
              Yorkshire Dales.

              Coverdale links Warfedale to Wensleydale and is known as the
              forgotten dale. Small villages are found nestled on hill sides and
              very little evidence of modern England is obvious. This makes
              Coverdale the perfect place to get away from the rush and relax.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              Take a walk around Tupgill Park and visit the famous Forbidden
              Corner, a series of follies created by Colin Armstrong, an
              eccentric millionaire and former ambassador of Ecuador. This
              labyrinth of tunnels, chambers and surprises will provide hours of
              fun and is highly recommended.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              There are also many amazing walks that you can follow around the

              The Coverdale grouse moors are one of the few places in England
              where the black grouse can be found within its natural habitat and
              is one of the many types of wild life that are native to the area.

              northern center for horse racing. A steady parade of race horses
              pass from the training yards each morning from the stables up to
              the famous Middleham gallops and back again. This is a must for
              all horse lovers.
