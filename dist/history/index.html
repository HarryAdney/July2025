Some History
</h2> <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed"> <p>
There has probably been an alehouse or pub on the present site
              since the 17th century. At one time it was known as 'The Hare and
              Hounds' and at another as 'The Board'. Soon after 1840, it
              probably became known locally as the 'Foresters' and its present
              name was certainly well-established by about 1870.
</p> <p>
The pub took its present name following the formation in 1837 of
              the Coverdale Branch of the Foresters' Friendly Society which came
              to hold its regular meetings in the long room on the upper floor
              at the western end of the building. In the 1840s, the 'Foresters'
              was one of three pubs in the village, an indication of the
              importance of the scale of the traffic then passing through
              Coverdale along the route from Skipton to Middleham and the north.

The 17th century building
</h3> <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-400 animate-fadeInUp delay-1"> <p class="leading-relaxed">
The present pub contains elements of an earlier building of
              possibly the late 17th century This was probably a single roomed
              farmhouse, the remains of which, including a blocked up fire
              window, can be still be seen at the eastern end of the present
              building: the farmhouse functions today as the snug. The 17th
              century house owner probably served home brewed ale to passing
              trade to supplement his farming income.

Developments in the 18th century
</h3> <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-400 animate-fadeInUp delay-1"> <p class="leading-relaxed">
By the early 18th century trade in ale may have been so good that
              the owner found it worthwhile to invest in his business. A bar
              room was built to the western side of the farmhouse and
              arrangements made to provide sleeping and stabling facilities. The
              current bar with its impressive corbelled fire place dates from
              this time. By the end of the 18th century, continuing good profits
              probably encouraged further investment and development of the inns
              in Carlton. The owner of the old Moorcock Inn, the other historic
              inn in the village, seems to have decided to rebuild an older
              pre-existing inn. Perhaps in response and to further distinguish
              his business, the owner of the Foresters' probably rebuilt the old
              stables and barn to the west of the bar, and he may have entirely
              replaced the roof. A new building with its gable end to the road
              was later constructed at the west end. It was on the first floor
              of this building that a 'Long Room ', which functioned as an
              Assembly room or village hall, was created.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
The inn must have been transformed by these building works and it
              probably looked then (round about 1800) much as it does today. The
              inn was now a tidy stone building under one roof with the western
              gabled building as a neat addition.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
It is not known who financed the building work. It may have been
              Roger Dawson of Middleham who owned the pub in the 18th century or
              possibly William Walls who bought it in 1797. If it was Walls he
              may have over- extended his financial investment since by 1818 he
              had to borrow money. He later sold the pub but retained the
              license. Mr Wall's Long Room, as it was named, had many different
              uses. In 1817 John Bowe (who became a Primitive Methodist
              preacher) recorded his conversion to Methodism after being
              inspired by a Methodist meeting held in the Long Room. In 1863
              Henry Constantine recorded the use of the Long Room for a dance in
              celebration of the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Princess
              Alexandra. In the 1940s the Long room was used for the wedding
              reception of the daughter of the licensee. Throughout much of the
              19th and well into the 20th centuries it almost certainly was used
              for the monthly meetings of the Friendly Society.

The building remained unchanged until the 1980s when the owners
                created a door in the NW corner of the bar to allow access to
                the former store rooms. The room nearer the bar became a family
                sitting room and an occasional tea room. A little later the
                other storeroom to the west became a pool and games room. The
                old Long Room was converted into bedrooms for guests.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
In 1990 a different owner reorganised and refurbished the
                building. The exterior of the building was transformed by
                constructing a porch over the main door. Inside, the pool room
                and tea room became a restaurant and another new door,
                immediately to the left of the entrance into the bar, allowed
                easy access to the 'old house' which became a back bar or snug.

Licensees of "The Foresters"
</h3> <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-400 animate-fadeInUp delay-1"> <p class="leading-relaxed">
The earliest recorded ale house keeper of the inn now called "The
              Foresters' Arms" was Edward Wright who held the license from 1775
              until 1779. Following this, it was most likely members of the
              Clough family who ran the pub until William Walls bought it from
              Roger Dawson of Middleham in 1797.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
The Walls family had an association with the pub that lasted for
              the next 125 years – sometimes as owners but always as landlords.
              William Walls senior, who probably organised the construction of
              the famous "Long Room," was succeeded by his son William in 1839.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
William Walls junior, born in 1808, married Ann Coates the
              daughter and granddaughter of local ale house keepers. William was
              a Forester so it may have been his decision to give the pub its
              current name. The Long Room was used as the court room for
              meetings and William and Ann were regarded as successful hosts. A
              report of the 1862 Foresters' Walk recorded -
</p> <blockquote class="pl-6 border-l-4 border-gold-accent italic">
"About 80 foresters assembled in the Court-Room at Brother William
              Walls', Foresters' Arms Inn, in Carlton."
</blockquote> <p class="leading-relaxed">
After a procession and service in the chapel - "the members and
              friends (above 100) dined together in the court-room, where the
              host and hostess provided a well-cooked and substantial meal."
              Following another procession through the village "they spent an
              enjoyable evening in the court-room." The members left at 9 p.m.
              after singing the National Anthem.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
When William Walls died in 1892 his son Joseph took over as
              licensee. Joe was assisted by his sister Isabella and in due
              course their niece Lily joined the team. The 1911 Census recorded
              them at The Foresters' Arms with 74 year old Joe described as the
              innkeeper. When Joe died in 1913 his probate document stated that
              he had died at "the said inn."

After the death of Joe Walls, Samuel Robert Bellamy took over as
                licensee. He placed an advert in the Leeds Mercury in February
                1914, offering a billiard table for sale.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
By June 1916 the licensee was Thomas Hancock. He too had
                something to sell but this time it was livestock - a
                cross-Airedale bloodhound dog. Later that year the license
                transferred to Thomas' father, William Waggett Hancock.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
In 1924 the Walls family sold the pub to Theakstons and George
                Binks took over as landlord. George and his wife Annie were a
                popular couple with Annie famous for her ham and egg breakfasts.
                They continued to welcome members of the Order of Foresters to
                the pub with the business of the Court still conducted in the
                Long Room.
</p> <p class="leading-relaxed">
George Binks retired in 1951 and James Corps took over the
                license. When Jim's daughter married in 1956 the happy young
                couple held their wedding reception in the Long Room. Jim and
                Annie Corps left the Foresters in 1960.
